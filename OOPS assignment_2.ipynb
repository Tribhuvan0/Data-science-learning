    "Answer 4.\n",
    "**Method Overriding in Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "- Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "- The overridden method in the subclass has the same signature (name and parameters) as the method in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Generic animal sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Usage:\n",
    "generic_animal = Animal()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(generic_animal.speak())  # Output: Generic animal sound\n",
    "print(dog.speak())             # Output: Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())             # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `Animal` class has a method called `speak` with a generic implementation.\n",
    "- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class and provide their own specific implementation of the `speak` method.\n",
    "- When an instance of `Dog` or `Cat` calls the `speak` method, the overridden method in the subclass is executed, providing a more specific behavior than the generic implementation in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding allows subclasses to tailor the behavior of inherited methods to suit their specific characteristics while still benefiting from the common interface defined in the superclass."

    "In Python, the property decorator is used to create properties, which are a special kind of attribute that can be accessed and modified like a regular attribute but is controlled by getter, setter, and deleter methods. Properties provide a way to implement computed attributes and add additional behavior to attribute access.\n",

    "**Significance of `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` in Python Polymorphism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`isinstance()`:**\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Checks if an object belongs to a specified class or is an instance of a subclass.\n",
    "  - **Significance:** Enables dynamic type checking, facilitating polymorphic behavior by determining the actual type of an object during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`issubclass()`:**\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Checks if a class is a subclass of another class.\n",
    "  - **Significance:** Allows verification of class relationships, helping in determining if a certain class can be used polymorphically in a specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "**Role of `@abstractmethod` Decorator in Achieving Polymorphism in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The `@abstractmethod` decorator, provided by the `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module, marks a method as abstract in an abstract class. Abstract methods have no implementation in the abstract class but must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Significance:** This decorator enforces a consistent interface across multiple classes, ensuring that subclasses adhere to the same set of methods. This consistency is essential for achieving polymorphism, as objects of different types can be treated interchangeably based on a shared interface.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance Summary:**\n",
    "- `@abstractmethod` ensures that the method marked as abstract has no implementation in the abstract class.\n",
    "- Abstract methods define a shared interface that concrete subclasses must implement, promoting a consistent structure across different classes.\n",
    "- This consistent interface is vital for polymorphism, allowing objects of different types to be used interchangeably based on the shared abstract methods."

    "Answer 13.**Use of `super()` Function in Python Polymorphism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The `super()` function is used to call methods from the parent class in the context of a subclass.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Significance:** In polymorphism, when a method is overridden in a subclass, `super()` allows the subclass to invoke the method from its superclass. This ensures that both the overridden method in the subclass and the original method in the superclass are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Generic animal sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",

    "        return f\"{super().speak()} Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example demonstrating super() in polymorphism\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.speak())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The `Animal` class has a method `speak()` that returns a generic animal sound.\n",
    "- The `Dog` class inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `speak()` method. Using `super().speak()` inside the `Dog` class ensures that the original `speak()` method from the `Animal` class is called.\n",
    "- The `super()` function facilitates the combination of behavior from both the subclass and the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Generic animal sound Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Ensures that the overridden method in a subclass can still utilize the functionality of the same method in its parent class.\n",
    "- Supports code reuse and maintains a clear hierarchy of behavior within the class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Concept of Operator Overloading in Python and its Relation to Polymorphism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operator Overloading:**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** Operator overloading in Python refers to defining how an operator behaves for user-defined objects. It allows you to define special methods in a class that will be called when certain operators are used on objects of that class.\n",
    "  - **Significance:** Enables the customization of the behavior of operators for user-defined types, making objects of those types compatible with standard operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relation to Polymorphism:**\n",
    "  - **Polymorphism Aspect:** Operator overloading is a form of polymorphism known as \"ad-hoc polymorphism\" or \"compile-time polymorphism.\" It allows objects of different types to be used interchangeably with common operators.\n",
    "  - **Consistent Interface:** By defining how operators behave for user-defined classes, operator overloading promotes a consistent interface across different types, supporting polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples using + and * operators:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ComplexNumber:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, real, imag):\n",
    "        self.real = real\n",
    "        self.imag = imag\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Operator overloading for addition (+)\n",
    "    def __add__(self, other):\n",

    "        )\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.real} + {self.imag}i\"\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Addition: 3 + 1i\n",
    "Multiplication: 8 + -1i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The `ComplexNumber` class defines special methods `__add__` and `__mul__` for overloading the addition and multiplication operators, respectively.\n",
    "- When the `+` and `*` operators are used with objects of the `ComplexNumber` class, the corresponding special methods are called, providing a custom behavior.\n",
    "- This approach ensures a consistent and intuitive use of operators across different types, showcasing polymorphic behavior through operator overloading.\n",

    "In summary, operator overloading in Python allows the customization of operator behavior for user-defined types, contributing to a consistent interface and supporting polymorphism by allowing objects of different types to use common operators in an intuitive way."

    "**Method Abstraction in Python and its Relation to Polymorphism:**\n",
    "- **Method Abstraction:**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** Hides the internal details of a method's implementation, exposing only its essential functionality.\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Emphasizes what a method does rather than how it achieves it.\n",
    "- **Relation to Polymorphism:**\n",
    "  - **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "    - **Definition:** Enables objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.\n",
    "    - **Achieved Through Method Abstraction:**\n",
    "      - Different classes can provide their own implementations of the same abstract method.\n",
    "      - Objects of these classes can be used interchangeably based on their shared method interface.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "        @abstractmethod\n",
    "        def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "            self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "        def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "            return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, length, width):\n",
    "            self.length = length\n",
    "            self.width = width\n",
    "\n",
    "        def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "            return self.length * self.width\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - **Flexibility:** Different classes can implement the same method in ways specific to their functionality.\n",
    "  - **Interchangeability:** Objects adhering to the same abstract method can be used interchangeably, promoting polymorphism."

    "Answer 1.\n",
    "**Composition in Python:**\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes.\n",
    "  - It enables building complex objects by combining simpler ones, creating a \"has-a\" relationship.\n",
    "- **Key Points:**\n",
    "  - **\"Has-a\" Relationship:**\n",
    "    - Represents the relationship where a class \"has\" another class as a component.\n",
    "  - **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "    - Encourages reusing existing classes rather than relying on inheritance.\n",
    "  - **Flexibility:**\n",
    "    - Provides a more flexible alternative to inheritance for building complex structures.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Engine:\n",
    "        def start(self):\n",
    "            return \"Engine started.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Wheels:\n",
    "        def roll(self):\n",
    "            return \"Wheels rolling.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.engine = Engine()  # Composition\n",
    "            self.wheels = Wheels()  # Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "        def drive(self):\n",
    "            return f\"{self.engine.start()} {self.wheels.roll()}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Example usage\n",
    "    my_car = Car()\n",
    "    print(my_car.drive())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - **Modularity:** Each component (class) can be developed and tested independently.\n",
    "  - **Encapsulation:** Components encapsulate their own functionalities, promoting information hiding.\n",
    "  - **Easy Maintenance:** Changes to one component have minimal impact on others, enhancing maintainability.\n",
    "  - **Code Reusability:** Components can be reused in different compositions, fostering code reuse."

    "1. **Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - Composition allows for more flexible and dynamic relationships between classes.\n",
    "   - Changes in one class do not necessarily affect the behavior of another, promoting adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Composition promotes code reuse by assembling objects with desired behaviors.\n",
    "   - Objects can be reused in various contexts, enhancing modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reduced Coupling:**\n",
    "   - Composition leads to loosely coupled classes, minimizing dependencies.\n",
    "   - Loose coupling improves maintainability and facilitates changes without affecting unrelated parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Rigidity:**\n",
    "   - Unlike inheritance, composition avoids the rigidity introduced by a fixed class hierarchy.\n",
    "   - Modifications to one class don't impose changes on unrelated classes, reducing unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",

    "Answer 17.\n",
    "**Aggregation in Composition:**\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Aggregation is a form of composition where one class (the whole) contains another class (the part), but the part can exist independently of the whole.\n",
    "  - It implies a relationship where one object is part of another but doesn't own the other object's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference from Simple Composition:**\n",
    "  - In simple composition, the composed object (part) is typically fully owned and managed by the containing object (whole).\n",
    "  - In aggregation, the part can exist independently, and the relationship is often more loosely coupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Department:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.employees = []  # Aggregation: Department has employees, but employees can exist independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, emp_id):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "# Example Usage:\n",
    "dept = Department(\"HR\")\n",
